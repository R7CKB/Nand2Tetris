## Project 8 - VM Translator

### Overview

This project involves building a Virtual Machine (VM) translator that can translate a program written in the VM language into assembly language. The translator consists of three main components: `Parser`, `CodeWriter`, and `Main`. This README provides an overview of the project structure and functionalities.

### Project Structure

The project is divided into three main components:

1. **Parser:** 
   - Parses each VM command into its lexical elements.
   - Identifies the command type (e.g., arithmetic, push, pop, label).
   - Extracts arguments from the command.

2. **CodeWriter:**
   - Writes assembly code based on the parsed VM command.
   - Handles arithmetic operations, push and pop commands, labels, conditional jumps, function calls, and returns.
   - Manage the translation of VM commands to assembly instructions.

3. **Main:**
   - Drive the translation process.
   - Compiles VM code into assembly code.
   - Utilize the Parser and CodeWriter components.

### Recommendations

- Before working on this project, it is recommended to review Project 4 for a better understanding of assembly language.
- The project assumes a basic understanding of the VM language.

### Usage

1. **Parser:**
   - Parses VM commands into lexical elements.
   - Identifies the command type.
   - Extracts arguments.

2. **CodeWriter:**
   - Write assembly code for various VM commands.
   - Handles arithmetic operations, push and pop commands, labels, jumps, function calls, and returns.

3. **Main:**
   - Drive the translation process.
   - Compiles VM code into assembly code.
   - Handles file input/output.

### Project Notes

- The VM translator follows a similar structure to an assembler but with some differences.
- Challenges are encountered in handling conditional jump commands.
- Comments are generated in the assembly code to aid in debugging.

### Recommendations and Acknowledgments

- The author suggests reviewing the book associated with this project for additional insights.
- Feedback on potential improvements or corrections to the code is appreciated, especially considering the authorâ€™s non-native English proficiency and novice status in Python.

### Execution

To execute the VM translator, run the following command:

```bash
python main.py <input_file_or_directory>
```

Replace `<input_file_or_directory>` with the path to the VM file or directory containing VM files to be translated.
