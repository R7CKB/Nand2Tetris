# Nand2Tetris Project

## Project Overview

This project is an implementation based on the Nand2Tetris course, aiming to deepen the understanding of computer hardware and software principles by going through the process from basic NAND gates to building a complete computer system.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into the following parts:

1. **Projects 1-5:** From basic NAND gates to building Arithmetic Logic Units (ALUs) and memory units.

2. **Projects 6-9:** Implementing the computer's CPU and corresponding assembly language.

3. **Projects 10-12:** Building a virtual machine and a high-level language compiler.

4. **Projects 13-14:** Implementing an operating system.
